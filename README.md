# dotfiles

Dotfiles for ArchLinux x86_64 & Ubuntu x86_64, managed by [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot).

An out-of-the-box configuration with multiple features, easy to install and customize.

**PRs are welcome.**

Notes:

1. **It's not a light-weight configuration; and only support for zsh & nvim.**
2. **Recommend to use a proxy in China Mainland, set `PROXY_IP` and `PROXY_ENABLED`.**
3. **There is no uninstall script yet.**. I suggest you to run inside docker to see if it meets your needs.
4. **Always clone this version with a tagged/release version, e.g. v3.0.0.**

## Supported OS

Fully supported and keep up-to-date:

- **ArchLinux x86_64** (also supported in WSL2)
- **Ubuntu 22.04 x86_64** (also supported in WSL2)
  only focus on one recently LTS version, because the required tools/packages are hard to maintain across different Ubuntu versions.

Partially supported:

- **Other Ubuntu x86_64 Versions**
  - Even running on Ubuntu 16.04 (offline, no root permission) can be OK with full features enabled
    - see: [How to Install on an Oldschool Server](https://github.com/ShangjinTang/dotfiles/wiki/How-to-Install-on-an-Oldschool-Server)
  - Essential Packages:
    - executables: **zsh**, **rustup & cargo**, **rtx**, **nvim**, **nodejs**, **tmux**, **rg(ripgrep)**, **fd(fd-find)**, **delta**
    - python3 packages: **pynvim**
  - You can download in executables in [CLI Prebuilts](https://github.com/ShangjinTang/cli-prebuilts).

Poorly supported:

- macOS 10.13 ~ 10.15 x86_64 (might be removed in the future).

## Installation

If you have a proxy, recommend to set proxy before installlation.

```bash
vim ~/.zshrc.local
```

```bash
export PROXY_IP="127.0.0.1:7890"
export PROXY_ENABLED=1
```

For more customized environments, see [zshrc.pre](https://github.com/ShangjinTang/dotfiles/blob/master/configs/zsh/zshrc.pre)

## Tips & Issue Fix

### rtx

- If you do not have a proxy, you might occur this issue in China Mainland. `rtx install python` is downloading from https://www.python.org, maybe the download is slow.
- If you have issue with `rtx` package, please remove the issue package from `.tool-versions` and manually install it.
- If you need to use a different version in a folder, use `rtx local <some-package>@<version-number>`
- `rtx` support all [asdf-plugins](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-plugins)

### nvim

1. You always need to use `:UpdateRemotePlugins` in nvim after python environment changes.
2. `pynvim` must be installed in current python.

#### nvim plugins

Sometimes you need to update plugins to fix plugin issues by executing `LvimSyncCorePlugins` in nvim.

#### nvim treesitter

Sometimes you need to update treesitter to fix it's issues by executing `:TSUpdate` in nvim.

This can solve issue as below:

```plain
treesitter/highlighter: Error executing lua:
.../share/nvim/runtime/lua/vim/treesitter/query.lua:161: query: invalid node type at position XXX
```

#### mason

Sometimes you have python binaries in `~/.local/share/nvim/mason/bin`,

But cannot execute, e.g. `black` `isort`. And nvim prints error or warning.

This is often due to python version/environment changes.

```python
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim/mason
```

Then open nvim to do a fresh install.
